        "Memorizing transformers are decoder-only transformers which have the ability to store in a non-differentiable memory the internal representations of past inputs, allowing to combine local attention with a $k$-nearest neighbors search into the memory. In particular, the architecture of these models uses standard transfomer blocks and a special transformer block that uses this modified version of the attention, taking also into consideration information from previous training steps. For simplicity, we will refer to this block as \"memory block\" in the remainder of this notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "As it is explained in the paper, the memory block is usually put almost at the end of the architecture and the use of more than one of these blocks doesn't result in better performances. We followed this approach and conduct our experiments by stacking multiple transformer blocks, followed by a memory block and by one last standard transformer block.\n",

        "The task that we are training our models on is language modeling. So the models are trained on their ability to predict the next word of a sequence given all the previous words in the sequence.

For the purpose of the memorizing transformer architecture, having small sequences such as lines as training samples wouldn't justify the use of the external memory. In fact, the documents should be divided in subsequences and each long document should be fed into the memorizing transformer sequentially from start to end without doing any shuffling.\n",

With the second approach the transformer would use the Bert model to create the embeddings. Moreover, in the first case it's better to use a deeper transformers with more blocks, while in the second case we tried with fewer blocks since Bert is already a deep transformer.\n",

        "A further experiment to do could be the memory fine-tuning, where a KNNMemory object is passed to a decoder-only transformer only after some training epochs. In order to do this we would need to modify the TransformerDecoder class or to create a memorizing transformer after some changes in the KNNAttention class. The latter method would consists in modifying the forward method of KNNAttention to handle a missing KNNMemory so that until we pass to the layer a memory the layer acts like a standard multi-head attention.\n",

It would be useful because the retrieval of the nearest neighbors from the external memory clearly makes the vanilla memorizing transformer slower than a regular decoder-only transformer and we could avoid for many training steps this computation and achieve the same results."
